# Poker Planning

This repository contains a small Poker Planning game. The code is split into `frontend` and `backend` directories.

- **frontend** – a Next.js application with basic components and a small
  Zustand store for local state.
- **backend** – SQL scripts for a Supabase/PostgreSQL setup using Supabase Realtime.

The frontend can handle up to 10 users per room. For realtime updates, the backend tables are configured to work with Supabase Realtime.

See the READMEs inside each folder for details.
